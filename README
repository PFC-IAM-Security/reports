# Identity & Access Management (IAM) – Security Portfolio

This repository collects structured, enterprise-grade documentation and simulations focused on **Identity & Access Security** within Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) and Microsoft 365 environments.

My work is centered on strengthening authentication, enforcing MFA, designing Conditional Access policies, and simulating identity-based attack scenarios—core skills required in modern Zero Trust architectures.

---

## 🔐 Focus Areas

- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enforcement  
- Conditional Access (CA) policy design  
- Identity Incident Response  
- Zero Trust identity principles  
- Identity Protection signals  
- Authentication method security (Authenticator App, FIDO2, number matching)  
- Baseline hardening for Microsoft cloud environments

## 📄 Included Projects

### ✔ MFA Inventory – EVM Rail
A real-world MFA adoption assessment conducted across 11 users.  
Includes:
- user risk classification  
- authentication method review  
- exposure analysis  
- operational plan for MFA rollout  

Demonstrates familiarity with Microsoft 365 authentication flows and identity risks.

---

### ✔ Conditional Access – Baseline Policy Design
A complete baseline Conditional Access blueprint, covering:
- Block Legacy Authentication  
- MFA for all users  
- MFA for administrative roles  
- High-risk sign-in protection  
- Geo-blocking guidelines  
- Zero Trust device considerations  

Shows ability to design enforceable identity security controls.

---

### ✔ Incident Simulation – Password Spray Attack
A realistic simulation highlighting:
- detection using Entra ID logs  
- early indicators  
- IAM-focused response steps  
- mitigation via Conditional Access & MFA  
- attacker behavior patterns  

Demonstrates analytical thinking and security reasoning.

---

### ✔ Incident Simulation – MFA Fatigue (Push Bombing)
Documents one of the most common modern MFA-bypass attempts.  
Covers:
- attack pattern  
- log indicators  
- user behavior exploitation  
- remediation  
- hardening with number matching and stronger factors  

Shows understanding of identity attack vectors and modern defenses.
