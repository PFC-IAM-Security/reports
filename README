# Identity & Access Management (IAM) – Security Portfolio

This repository documents my work, studies, and practical experience in **Identity & Access Security**, specifically focused on **Microsoft 365** and **Entra ID** (formerly Azure AD).

My objective is to provide clear, structured, and enterprise-grade documentation and simulations that reflect real scenarios in modern identity security.

---

## 🔐 Focus Areas
This repository covers:

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** inventory and risk assessment  
- **Conditional Access** design principles  
- **Identity Incident Response** simulations  
- **Zero Trust identity approach**  
- **Authentication methods** and security best practices  
- **Baseline identity hardening** for Microsoft environments  

These are the core components of modern identity security and are directly linked to the most requested roles in the industry.

## 📁 Repository Structure

```
/reports
    MFA-Inventory-EVM-Rail.md

/conditional-access
    (coming next: baseline CA policy set)

/incident-simulation
    (coming next: password spray analysis, MFA fatigue case)
```

Each folder contains documentation designed to reflect real enterprise operations.

## 🧩 Why Identity Security?
Identity is the new security perimeter.  
Most modern attacks (BEC, password spray, session hijacking, phishing bypasses) target user access, not firewalls.

Working on identity means working at the core of cloud security.

## 📄 Included Projects

### ✔ MFA Inventory – EVM Rail
A real-world MFA adoption assessment across 11 users, including:
- risk classification  
- authentication method analysis  
- exposure scenarios  
- minimum operational plan  

This serves as a foundational document for any IAM rollout.

### ✔ Conditional Access (coming soon)
A clean, structured design for:
- Block Legacy Authentication  
- MFA for all users  
- Role-based access  
- Sign-in risk conditions  
- Basic Zero Trust posture  

### ✔ Incident Response Simulations (coming soon)
- Password Spray detection & response  
- MFA Fatigue attack simulation  
- Session token theft scenario
